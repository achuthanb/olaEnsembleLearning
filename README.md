The problem at hand for Ola is the high churn rate among its drivers, which poses challenges in terms of recruitment costs, morale impact, and overall operational efficiency. As the company expands, this churn rate could exacerbate, making it imperative to address this issue effectively.

The goal is to predict driver attrition based on various attributes such as demographics, tenure information, and historical performance data. By leveraging data science techniques, Ola aims to identify drivers who are more likely to leave the company, thereby enabling targeted retention efforts.

Key aspects of the problem include:

High Churn Rate: The turnover of drivers is significant, leading to continuous recruitment efforts and associated costs.

Cost of Acquisition vs. Retention: Acquiring new drivers is expensive compared to retaining existing ones. Thus, it's crucial to focus on retaining current drivers rather than solely relying on recruiting new ones.

Driver Demographics: Factors such as city, age, and gender could influence attrition rates and thus need to be considered in the predictive model.

Tenure Information: Details like joining date and the duration of service provide insights into the stability of a driver's relationship with the company.

Performance Metrics: Historical data related to driver performance, including ratings, business acquired, grades, and income, can offer valuable indicators of job satisfaction and engagement, impacting retention likelihood.

By analyzing these diverse factors through data science methodologies, Ola aims to develop predictive models that can identify drivers at risk of leaving. This proactive approach enables the implementation of targeted strategies to improve driver retention, ultimately enhancing operational stability and reducing recruitment costs.
